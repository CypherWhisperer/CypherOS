# Minecraft via Prism Launcher — the recommended open-source launcher on NixOS.
#
# LAUNCHER CHOICE:
#   Prism Launcher (default) — open source MultiMC fork, best general choice.
#   ATLauncher (alternative)  — modpack-focused, also in nixpkgs.
#   TLauncher               —  Unofficial, privacy-invasive.
#
# WHY PRISM
#   TLauncher is an unofficial launcher with a poor privacy track record.
#   Prism Launcher is fully open source (MultiMC fork), in nixpkgs, and
#   explicitly recommended by the NixOS wiki. It handles multiple instances,
#   all mod loaders (Fabric, Forge, Quilt, NeoForge), and CurseForge/Modrinth
#   integration cleanly.
#
# WHY NOT ATLAUNCHER:
#   ATLauncher is also fine and in nixpkgs (pkgs.atlauncher), but it's
#   more modpack-oriented. Prism is the better general-purpose choice.
#   Swap the package below if you prefer ATLauncher.
#
# JAVA STRATEGY:
#   Prism uses system Java by defult.Multiple Java versions can be added
#   via the prismlauncher.override mechanism (see commented section below).
#   We override to provide all three generations so Prism can auto-select per
#   instance without downloading its own JREs.
#   Different MinceCraft versions require diff java:
#     Java  8  → MC < 1.17
#     Java 17  → MC 1.18–1.20.4
#     Java 21  → MC 1.20.5+ (current)
#
# INSTANCE STORAGE:
#   Prism stores instances in ~/.local/share/PrismLauncher/instances/.
#   This is worth including in our personal data backup.
#
#   Point Prism's instance directory at our local Minecraft path so instances
#   live alongside your other game data under ~/DATA/FILES/GAMING/.
#   Settings > Launcher > Folders > Instance Folder →
#     ~/DATA/FILES/GAMING/local/Minecraft/
#
# FIRST-RUN:
#   1. Launch Prism — add your Microsoft/Mojang account
#   2. Optionally point instance storage at your BTRFS shared data path
#      (Settings > Launcher > Folders > Instance Folder)
