#
# Tor Browser module for CypherOS.
#
# ── THREAT MODEL CONTEXT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Tor Browser is NOT a daily driver. It is a precision instrument for cases
#   where dissociating your real identity from your network traffic is the
#   primary goal. Use it when:
#     - Accessing .onion services
#     - Communicating with sources where IP exposure is unacceptable
#     - Operating under a threat model where your ISP, Cloudflare, or a
#       national network observer is an adversary
#     - You need plausible deniability about which site you accessed
#
#   Use Mullvad Browser for everyday sensitive browsing.
#   Use Tor Browser only when anonymity is the mission-critical requirement.
#
# ── HOW TOR BROWSER ACHIEVES ANONYMITY ───────────────────────────────────────
#   1. Circuit routing: traffic exits through 3 hops (Guard → Middle → Exit).
#      No single node knows both source and destination.
#
#   2. Fingerprint uniformity: identical UA, window size, fonts, canvas noise
#      across all Tor Browser users — same model as Mullvad Browser.
#
#   3. No persistent state: cookies, cache, history cleared per-session.
#   4. JavaScript sandboxed via NoScript (configurable per-security-level).
#
# ── SECURITY LEVELS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Standard  → JS enabled everywhere. Same as normal browsing. Weakest.
#   Safer     → JS disabled on non-HTTPS sites. Some media disabled.
#   Safest    → JS disabled EVERYWHERE. Only essential HTML/CSS loads.
#               Breaks most of the clearnet. Correct for high-stakes sessions.
#
#   The security level is set in-browser via the Shield icon → Change...
#   It CANNOT be set declaratively in NixOS — Tor Browser manages it in its
#   own profile directory which is outside our control by design.
#   When you launch for a sensitive session: always check the level first.
#
# ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Installs tor-browser from nixpkgs (the official Tor Project build,
#   verified with upstream signatures in nixpkgs). Enables the tor daemon
#   as a systemd service for circuit reuse across sessions if desired.
#
#   NixOS ships `tor-browser` (the browser bundle) and `tor` (the daemon)
#   as separate packages. The browser bundle includes its own tor binary
#   for standalone use — the system tor daemon is optional but gives you
#   persistent circuits and can be shared with other tor-aware tools
#   (e.g. torsocks, OnionShare, Ricochet-Refresh).
#
# ── OPERATIONAL SECURITY NOTES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#   These are not Nix concerns — they are human behaviour concerns:
#
#   1. Never maximise the Tor Browser window. Tor normalises window sizes
#      to buckets; maximising reveals your real screen resolution.
#
#   2. Never install additional extensions. One extra extension = unique fingerprint.
#
#   3. Never log into personal accounts (Google, email, social) while on Tor.
#      The moment you log in, anonymity is gone regardless of the network layer.
#
#   4. Never torrent over Tor. Torrents bypass SOCKS proxy and leak real IP.
#
#   5. Never open documents (PDF, DOCX) downloaded over Tor in external apps
#      while connected — they may call home via non-Tor network paths.
#
#   6. Be aware of timing correlation attacks: a global adversary watching
#      both your guard node traffic and the exit can correlate sessions
#      even without decrypting them. This is Tor's known unsolved problem.
#
# ── CATPPUCCIN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   EXCLUDED — same reasoning as Mullvad Browser. Theming = unique fingerprint.
#   catppuccin/nix does not support tor-browser and should never be applied.
#
# ── VERIFYING THE PACKAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   nixpkgs ships the official Tor Project build with upstream signature
#   verification during the build phase. You can confirm the package hash
#   and source against https://www.torproject.org/download/
#     nix eval --raw nixpkgs#tor-browser.src.url
#     nix eval --raw nixpkgs#tor-browser.version
