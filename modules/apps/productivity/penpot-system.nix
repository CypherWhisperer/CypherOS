# modules/apps/productivity/penpot-system.nix — system-level declarations 4 Penpot
#
# This module handles two system concerns required for the local Penpot instance:
#
#   1. /etc/hosts entry — resolves design.penpot.local to 127.0.0.1
#   2. Caddy local CA trust — adds Caddy's generated root cert to the
#      system trust store so browsers accept https://design.penpot.local
#      without security warnings.
#
# Import this module in your CypherOS system configuration:
#
#
# ── Migration note ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The networking.hosts entry and security.pki.certificateFiles entry here are
# Penpot-specific and intentionally scoped to this module. When a dedicated
# CypherOS local networking module is built (see the planned NixOS networking
# deep-dive session), these declarations should migrate there. At that point:
#
#   - networking.hosts becomes a central registry of local service domains
#   - security.pki.certificateFiles becomes a shared list of trusted local CAs
#   - This module either imports from that networking module or is dissolved
#
# This module serves as the reference implementation for that pattern.
# See: ADR-004-hosts-file-pending-resolved.md from cypher-penpot Project.

        # ── Caddy local CA trust ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
        # Caddy generates a local CA on first run and stores the root certificate at:
        #
        #   <caddy-data-volume>/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt
        #
        # Which on this machine resolves to:
        #
        #   /home/cypher-whisperer/DATA/FILES/DE_FILES/SHARED/APPS/Penpot/
        #     NEW_SCHOOL/PERSISTENT_INSTANCE_DATA/caddy/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt
        #
        # IMPORTANT — bootstrap sequence:
        #   1. Run `docker compose up -d` first to let Caddy generate its CA.
        #   2. Verify the root.crt file exists at the path above.
        #   3. Then run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply this config.
        #   4. After rebuild, browsers on this machine will trust the cert.
        #
        # If Caddy is ever recreated and generates a new CA (rare — the caddy/data
        # volume is persistent), repeat step 3 to re-trust the new certificate.
        security.pki.certificateFiles = [
          /home/cypher-whisperer/DATA/FILES/DE_FILES/SHARED/APPS/Penpot/NEW_SCHOOL/PERSISTENT_INSTANCE_DATA/caddy/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt
