# modules/apps/productivity/zathura.nix
#
# Zathura — minimalist, keyboard-driven document viewer (PDF, DjVu, PS, CB).
#
# Managed via HM's programs.zathura module, which is required for catppuccin/nix
# to inject the Catppuccin theme. Installing zathura via environment.systemPackages
# bypasses the catppuccin hook — this module is the correct path.
#
# Catppuccin theming: with catppuccin.autoEnable = true globally, the
# catppuccin/nix module for programs.zathura activates automatically and writes
# the Mocha colour palette into programs.zathura.options.
