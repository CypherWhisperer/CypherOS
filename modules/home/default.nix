# modules/home/default.nix
#
# Home Manager evaluation root for cypher-whisperer.
#
# RESPONSIBILITIES:
#   1. Unconditionally import every module that declares cypher-os.* options —
#      options must exist in the merged set before any mkIf can reference them.
#   2. Own home.stateVersion — set once, never change.
#   3. Own nothing else. DE config, app config, and profile defaults all live
#      in their respective modules and are activated via cypher-os options.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT LIVE HERE:
#   - DE-specific config              → modules/de/<de>.nix
#   - App package lists               → modules/apps/<group>/default.nix
#   - Profile cascade logic           → modules/profile/default.nix
#   - System-level config             → hosts/nixos/configuration.nix
