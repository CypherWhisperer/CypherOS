# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document significant decisions made during the design and development of CypherOS — what was decided, why, what alternatives were considered, and what the consequences are.

Each ADR is a permanent record. Once accepted, an ADR is not deleted — it may be superseded by a later ADR, which references it.
