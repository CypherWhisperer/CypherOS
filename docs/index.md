## Vision & Roadmap

These live at the repository root:

- [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md) — the design intent, the five pillars, what success looks like
- [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) — implementation phases and pending work
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) — notable changes per version, linked to ADRs and incidents
