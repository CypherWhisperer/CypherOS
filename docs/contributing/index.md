# Contributing

Conventions, workflow, and standards for working on the CypherOS repository. The goal of these conventions is that working in this repo feels consistent and predictable — _and eventually, second nature._

## Quick Reference — Conventions at a Glance

- **Documentation format:** Markdown for everything. Mermaid for all diagrams.
- **Default branch:** `master`
- **Commit format:** Conventional Commits — `type(scope): message`
- **ADR:** Write one for every significant architectural or tooling decision. Write it _before_ implementing where possible.
- **Journal:** One entry per meaningful development session. Informal — honest beats polished.
- **Incident:** One document per incident. Linked from every artifact it affected.
- **Inline comments:** First-class in Nix modules. A well-commented module is self-documenting.
